                My name is Mayu and I am originally from Los Angeles, California. I moved to Miami five years ago to attend to study Criminology
                at the University of Miami. I currently live in Brickell with my best friend, Martha, and our two pets. We
                have a pomeranian named Logan and a cat named Lucy. I am currently working at Apple in the Genius Bar where
                I offer customers technical support for their devices. I am learning how to code in order to further my career
                with the company and eventually land a corporate position as a software developer.I am excited to take this
                class and learn a new language. My name is Mayu and I am originally from Los Angeles, California. I moved to Miami five years ago to attend to study Criminology
